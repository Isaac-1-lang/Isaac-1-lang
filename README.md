## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a motivated software engineering student with strong hands-on experience building backend systems, full-stack web applications, and beginner-to-intermediate AI projects.  
My long-term goal is to become a **cybersecurity engineer** with solid foundations in **systems programming, networking, and secure software design**.

I enjoy working close to how systems actually work — from low-level C programming and databases, to web backends and deployment.

**What I focus on most:**
- ⚙️ Designing backend systems using Java (Servlets/JSP), Node.js and REST APIs  
- 🧠 Building beginner-friendly AI and deep learning projects using TensorFlow  
- 🔐 Learning cybersecurity fundamentals (network security, cryptography, OS concepts, C for security)  
- 🧪 Practicing problem-solving and algorithms (competitive programming & Olympiad preparation)  
- 🌍 Building technology solutions for education and community impact

I am also actively working on projects aimed at improving access to digital systems for students in boarding schools in Rwanda.

**Current Focus:**  
Cybersecurity foundations, backend engineering, AI-powered applications, and systems programming in C.
